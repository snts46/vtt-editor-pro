## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in VTT Editor Pro, please report it privately:

1. **GitHub**: Use [Private vulnerability reporting](https://github.com/RDTvlokip/vtt-editor-pro/security/advisories/new)
3. **Ko-fi**: https://ko-fi.com/rdtvlokip

**Please do not open public issues for security vulnerabilities.**

I will respond within 48 hours and work on a fix as quickly as possible.

## Security Considerations

VTT Editor Pro runs entirely in your browser:
- No data is sent to external servers
- Audio files stay local
- Auto-save uses localStorage only

For commercial deployments, review the code before use.
